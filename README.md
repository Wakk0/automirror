# Automirror
* Generate your own debian mirrors with debmirror.
* Web UI to generates iso images with your mirror and jigdo-lite.

This scritp is only for safe time if you need to make a local mirror in your place (home, office, lab). Perhaps exist better
ways to do it.

I have years using this method, some time ago i decided to publish this solution to make life easier to someone else.
